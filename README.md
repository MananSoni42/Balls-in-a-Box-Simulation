# Balls-in-a-Box-Simulation
This will simulate the effect of having 'n' Balls in a closed Box
Initially you have to enter the number of particles you want to have in the box (Eg.-7)
Then it will ask whether you want to randomly allot properties to particles or you want specific values

Properties include things like:
1. The particle's Postion
2. The particle's initial velocity
3. The particle's coeffficient of restitution 
and so on

This code is NOT perfect and OFTEN the particles resort to undefined behaviour due to bugs that I have not been able to find,
So please excuse me for these
